
Performance monitor settings:

Monitor timespan: 5 minutes
Monitored data: 

- Network interface
The Network Interface performance object consists of counters that measure the rates at which bytes and packets are sent and received over a TCP/IP network connection.  It includes counters that monitor connection errors.
	-> Bytes Received/sec: 
	-> Bytes Sent/sec: 
	
- Physical Disk
	-> %Disk Read Time
	% Disk Read Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive was busy servicing read requests.
	-> %Disk Write Time
	% Disk Write Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive was busy servicing write requests.

- Process
The Process performance object consists of counters that monitor running application program and system processes.  All the threads in a process share the same address space and have access to the same data.
	-> %Processor Time
	% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.
	-> IO Data bytes/sec
	The rate at which the process is reading and writing bytes in I/O operations. This counter counts all I/O activity generated by the process to include file, network and device I/Os.
	-> IO Data Operations/sec
	The rate at which the process is issuing read and write I/O operations. This counter counts all I/O activity generated by the process to include file, network and device I/Os.
